# Plan for Web Page Implementation

## Overview

The web page design consists of several key sections, each with specific elements and layout considerations:

1. **Header**: 
   - Contains the logo "jive" on the left.
   - Navigation links "Login" and "Sign up" on the right.
   - Positioned at the top of the page with a simple, clean design.

2. **Hero Section**:
   - Centralized headline: "Donâ€™t make connecting awkward".
   - Subtext explaining the service.
   - A prominent "Sign up free" button below the text.
   - Background includes abstract shapes for visual interest.

3. **Image Section**:
   - Two smartphone images displayed side by side.
   - Positioned centrally below the hero section.
   - Images are slightly tilted for a dynamic look.

4. **Features Section**:
   - Title: "Here's how it works".
   - Three feature descriptions, each with an icon, title, and text.
   - Features are laid out in a horizontal row.
   - A "Start jiving" button below the features.

5. **Footer**:
   - Logo "jive" at the center.
   - Additional links: "About", "Privacy", "Terms", "Contact".
   - Positioned at the bottom with a minimalistic design.

   - Contains the logo on the left.
   - Navigation links for "Login" and "Sign up" on the right.

2. **Hero Section**:
   - Centralized bold text with a tagline.
   - Subtext explaining the service.
   - A prominent "Sign up free" button.
   - Background with abstract colorful shapes.

   - Two overlapping smartphone images showcasing a QR code and a messaging interface.
   - Positioned centrally with colorful abstract shapes in the background.

4. **How It Works Section**:
   - Title and subtitle centered.
   - Three columns explaining the process with icons and descriptions.
   - A "Start Jiving" button centered below the descriptions.

5. **Footer**:
   - Contains the logo and tagline.
   - Links for "About," "Privacy," "Terms," and "Contact."

### Implementation Options

- **Flexbox vs. Grid**: 
  - **Flexbox** is suitable for the header and footer for horizontal alignment.
  - **CSS Grid** can be used for the "How It Works" section to easily manage the three-column layout.
  
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Use media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes, particularly for the image section and the three-column layout.

- **Background Shapes**:
  - Use CSS for positioning and layering the abstract shapes to ensure they remain responsive and maintain their positions relative to other elements.
